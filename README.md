This repository contains the Solutions in python to the Applied exercises from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" 2023 Edition by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.

## About the Book
An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance, marketing, and astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data.

## Repository Structure
This is the organisation of the repository:

- **[datasets](https://github.com/alexduartehc/ISPL-Solution/tree/main/datasets)**: This directory contains all the datasets necessary to complete the applied exercises.
- **[Exercises](https://github.com/alexduartehc/ISPL-Solution/tree/main/Exercises)**: This directory contains the solutions. Each chapter has its own directory named "Chapter " followed by the chapter's number. Inside each chapter directory, there is a specidic file for each exercise.

## Disclaimer
Unfortunately, there were a few exercises I did not solve, as they were very similar to other exercises in the book. 
The solutions in this repository are only intended for educational purposes and can be used as a reference to aid in understanding the concepts presented.
Feel free to modify the solutions and create your own implementations of each applied exercise.
